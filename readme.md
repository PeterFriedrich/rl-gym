# Rl-gym

This repo implements the code from the UAlberta RL Specialization on various environments from the OpenAI Atari Gym.

Currently one for each course:

1. Find a bandit environment 
	a. Contextual Bandits?

2. Implement a table based agent

3. Implement an agent with a tile coder (probably MsPacman)

4. Implement an agent with a NN (probably MsPacman)
